<ins>My process</ins> :

Built with :

- Semantic HTML5 ( main / picture / source )
- CSS rules ( @media / @font-family)
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Grid ( for body )

<ins>What I learned</ins> : 

This second project was really tougher than my first project.
I was going first for a multiple CSS grid with a lot of <article> element / <section> element  and so on, when just <div>  were necessary... ! Then I was so confused by the amount of CSS properties to use :) .
However, I get some helps in Slack ( I will thank him later ) so the following was a bit easier.
First time working on both mobile and desktop layout and using CSS rules, so I'm proud of me, even if there are still bugs to fix.
  
<ins>Continued develoment</ins>:

I need to continue to work on Flexbox/grid CSS and also work more on how to use units (em/rem/vh/vw/etc...)
I have also some struggles with with the layout ( maybe my padding or whatever isn't very optimal ), however, I will strive to gain experience on this in my next projects !
  
<ins>Useful ressources</ins>:
  
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ : This website really helped me to understand how grid box work, very useful.

https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp : Another website to visualise grid boxes
  
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face-in-css/ : If you want to understand how to use the font-face rules ( to work with unpublished font )
